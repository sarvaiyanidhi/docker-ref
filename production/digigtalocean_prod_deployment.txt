Steps to deploy

    Paste the copied token in the terminal at the end of this lesson against DIGITAL_OCEAN_TOKEN and save it.

    To create the manager instance click on the Run button. The following command is used to create the instance:

    docker-machine create \
        --driver digitalocean \
        --digitalocean-access-token $DIGITAL_OCEAN_TOKEN \
        --digitalocean-region lon1 \
        --engine-install-url "https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/19.03.9.sh" \
    do-manager-1

    Get the manager’s internal IP address by using the following command and replace <YOUR_INTERNAL_IP> in notepad.txt.

    docker-machine ssh do-manager-1 "ifconfig eth0" | grep 'inet addr:'

    With DigitalOcean, docker-machine’s SSH session is configured to connect as the root user. So, to initialize the swarm, copy the updated command in notepad.txt and run it in the terminal.

    Replace the <SWARM_TOKEN> in the workers.sh by the swarm token that will be given in the output. Also, replace <YOUR_INTERNAL_IP> in workers.sh with the internal IP you found before.

    Run docker-machine ls and copy the IP and port of the manager’s instance and place it in file pointToCli.bash_rc in front of:

    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://

    Click the Run button.

    Note: You can switch to the Terminal tab once the Output tab in the terminal below says “Output will be displayed when server responds…”.

    To create two instances and connect them to the swarm, run:

    chmod +x workers.sh && source ./workers.sh

    To point the manager instance to CLI, run:

    chmod +x pointToCli.sh && source ./pointToCli.sh

    Note: You do not need to update the security group to allow swarm ports since with DigitalOcean, these ports were open by default.

    Deploy the app:

    docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml myapp

    You should now be able to reach the app by visiting http://IP_AddressOfNode/welcome. You can list the node IPs by doing this:

    docker-machine ls

    Also visit http://IP_AddressOfNode:8080 to see the visualizer.
